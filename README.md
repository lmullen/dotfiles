# Dotfiles

Lincoln Mullen | <lincoln@lincolnmullen.com> | <http://lincolnmullen.com>

These are my dotfiles. I use Vim, Git, R, and ZSH, mostly, on both Ubuntu and Mac OS X. My Vim configuration files are now in a [vimrc](https://github.com/lmullen/vimrc) repository. Undoubtedly there are many things in this repository that I have borrowed from other people, and I've tried to give credit where credit is due.
