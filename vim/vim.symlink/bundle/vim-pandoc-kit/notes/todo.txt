ASK LIST:
how to determine raw tex? currently just begin/end and initial / on a line
but this is sloppy

any blocks that allow blanks need to be checked to see if they allow for html 
comments inline (I think pretty much all except for code/verbatim blocks) and 
highlight this appropriately.

TODO:
solarized: remove the initial h1 and everything turns into a table

fix lookahead in the top two simple link regions to not eat up multiple link 
refs if there is a colon following one of them

see the mutt solarized readme, the vim solarized readme for some interesting 
issues:
1. a paragraph with an internal initial word followed by a period (single word) 
   is interpreted as a list item
2. list with a indented code block isn't highlighted

provisional guidelines:
don't use both heading and list folding?
use just heading folding OR all other folding
set foldnextmax to a limit like... 6? 10?
maybe it's just a matter of setting syncmaxlines to a smaller number?
maybe i just need to point sync to the heading

add in autodetect of code blocks for syntax load
document the dynamic code blocks! how to load, etc.

" REMOVED FROM BLOCKQUOTES... @pandocInlineElements,@pandocStyles
DOUBLE CHECK WITH MAILING LIST ABOUT THIS
ask mailing list if inline tex always goes to line end or bracket close

turn on spelling and see where/how i need to turn it off

SYNTAX: back check to last blank line and then forwards from there should be 
good enoough... speed?

performance tests
OPEN SCRATCH, LINE 1000, rapid entry

consider sync type
clean up code, refactor
test links, multiline and other cases
test image links, consider alternate conceal icon

POSSIBLE
consider changing delimited code block to highlight only the ~'s via char 
replacement/contain or via different matching (zero match the spaces)
add delim code block replacement char

PANDOC
STYLES
refactor links, link colors, conceal, etc.
really shoudl style the linkURL differently so that it pops even in the default 
styling.
FUNCTIONS
function/command to quickly turn on folding / turn off folding / show fold 
column
look for functions to wrap styles around words/selection
  make otherwise

SOLARIZED
links should be underlined
tables... special styles?
footnotes should have an extra kick
tweak defaults
work on heading styles
bold/highlighted footnote leader (in actual note)
definition first line bold
tables... special styles? they should stand out more.
links need more love... refine the underlining and colors across links, urls, 
etc.

consider the alternate lighter back in solarized:
    let s:g_back        = "#0a1c23"
or just a hair darker?


last change script of some sort

clean up colors!
colors for heading styles

consider shift from base00 to base0

help files for solarized and pandoc syntax

see http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=923 for example of a decent 
how to install ref
