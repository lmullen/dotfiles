# Dotfiles

Lincoln Mullen | <lincoln@lincolnmullen.com> | <http://lincolnmullen.com>

These are my dotfiles. I use ZSH, Vim, iTerm2, Git, Ruby, and R, mostly.  

Undoubtedly there are many things in this repository that I have 
borrowed from other people, and I've tried to give credit where credit 
is due. In particular, I initially cloned Zach Holman's [dotfiles 
repository](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). The system of 
installing dotfiles and organizing them by topic, along with many of the 
specific settings, are derived from him. 

There are a number of submodules in this repository, mostly for Vim 
plugins. Yes, I hate submodules as much as you.
